Topic models ~\cite{steyvers2006probabilistic,blei2011introduction} are a suite of algorithms that aim at expressing documents as a mixture of topics. A topic is a distribution over words. Topic models are generative models, A document is generated by first choosing a distribution over topics, then randomly choosing a topic from this distribution and draw a word from that topic. Using standard inference techniques the parameters for the distributions can be infered. In this chapter we will be descussing Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and Probabilistic Latent Sequential Motifs (PLSM). These models do not make any assumptions about the order of the words in the document. This is know as the bag of words approach to modeling text.
