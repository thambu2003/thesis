\maketitle
% maketitle is a huge command in a small package.  It will render the title page, copyright page, acknowledgements, abstract, and probably a bunch of other stuff that I'm forgetting about.  If you choose not to define copyright, acknowledgements, etc, it automatically doesn't render them.

% other optional frontmatter could go somewhere in here.  dedication, biography, etc.  Grad school lists approved frontmatter pages somewhere.
% most frontmatter than I consider silly is not yet automated.  Also most frontmatter doesn't have any explicit style requirements, so I feel justified in ignoring it.

\tableofcontents %don't move this around too much
\listoftables %optional, but this is the spot it should go
\listoffigures %optional, but this is the right location for it

\mainmatter %switches page numbering to normal, resets page counter, etc.

\section{A new definition of dimension?}

Will you unite the disparate definitions of the current science? 

\subsection{A subsection}

% This is still experimental.  I hear that perhaps the full caption should go above the table, in which case we would do:
% \begin{table}[htp]
% \caption[short version of caption]{Longer, more detailed caption, perhaps containing a real description of the table's contents. \label{table:faketable}}
% \begin{tabular}...
\begin{table}[htp]
\caption{Test Table \label{table:faketable}}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Item 1 & Item 2 & Item 3\\
\hline
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth} ~\\ \footnotesize
Here is a table with nothing in it.  This is the caption for the table.  It's only here to make sure that the list of tables is working correctly, and as just a double check on basic table sort of stuff.
\end{minipage}%clunky.  Need to make this look better.
\end{table}

This text here is the ``actual" location of table \ref{table:faketable}.  Since tables are floating objects, the table itself may have moved around so as to better fit on the page.  I used the options \verb-[htp]-, which should attempt to place the table \verb-h-ere, or if that fails, at the \verb-t-op of this or the next page\footnote{I'm not sure if the top option will still do next page now that we are using the single side option for amsbook.}, or if that fails, on a \verb-p-age containing only floats.  The float page gets purged at the end of each section, I think.  You can also use global options to specify that all floats end up in special places, like pages containing only floats.

\subsection{Another Subsection}

Automatically generated nonsense text

\begin{sidewayspage}
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Sideways Table \label{table:sidetable}}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|ccc|}
\hline
Item 1 & Item 2 & Item 3 & more items & more items & more items\\
\hline
\hline
1 & 2 & 3 & x & x & x\\
4 & 5 & 6 & x & x & y\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{sidewayspage}

Here is some text inserted after the sideways table.  Hopefully the table will float, not forcing a break before this text.  If these lines are right at the top of a new page, something might be wrong.
